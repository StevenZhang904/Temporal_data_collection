    "Whenever we use an alarm clock, we perform commonsense reasoning about triggered events. The alarm going off is a triggered event, and we can formalize the operation of an alarm clock using trigger axioms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with some effect axioms. If a clock’s alarm time is t1 and an agent sets the clock’s alarm time to t2, then the clock’s alarm time will be t2 and will no longer be t1.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an agent turns on a clock’s alarm, then it will be on.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an agent turns off a clock’s alarm, then it will no longer be on.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an alarm starts beeping, then it will be beeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an agent turns off a clock’s alarm, then the clock will no longer be beeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a state constraint that says that a clock has a unique alarm time at any given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we use a trigger axiom. If a clock’s alarm time is the present moment and the alarm is on, then the clock starts beeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us use the following observations and narrative. At timepoint 0, the alarm is not on, the alarm is not beeping, and the alarm time is set to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "At timepoint 0, Nathan sets the alarm clock for timepoint 2; and at timepoint 1, he turns on the alarm.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then show that the alarm clock will be beeping at timepoint 3."

    " **Q1. What is the initial state of the alarm clock at timepoint 0?**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Q2. What action does Nathan perform at timepoint 0, and what is its effect on the alarm time?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A2.** At timepoint 0, Nathan sets the alarm clock for timepoint 2. This changes the alarm time from the previous value of 10 to 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. What action does Nathan take at timepoint 1, and what is the resulting state of the alarm?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A3.** At timepoint 1, Nathan turns on the alarm. As a result, the alarm becomes active (it is now on).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. According to the trigger axiom, what condition causes the alarm to start beeping?**\n",

    "**A4.** If the clock’s alarm time is the present moment and the alarm is on, then the clock starts beeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. At which timepoint does the alarm start beeping, and why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A5.** The alarm starts beeping at timepoint 3 because the alarm was set for timepoint 2 and turned on at timepoint 1. By timepoint 2, the present moment matches the alarm time, triggering the beeping at the next timepoint, which is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "**Q6. If Nathan had turned off the alarm at timepoint 1 instead of turning it on, what would be the state of the alarm at timepoint 3?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A6.** If Nathan had turned off the alarm at timepoint 1, the alarm would remain off and would not beep at timepoint 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. Suppose Nathan sets a new alarm time to 4 at timepoint 2 while the alarm is on. When would the alarm start beeping?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A7.** If the alarm time is set to 4 at timepoint 2 while the alarm is on, the alarm would start beeping at timepoint 5 when the present moment matches the new alarm time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q8. What state constraint ensures consistency in the alarm clock's behavior, and how does it apply in this scenario?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A8.** The state constraint ensures that the clock has a unique alarm time at any given time. In this scenario, when Nathan sets the alarm time to 2 at timepoint 0, the alarm time changes from 10 to 2, maintaining only one active alarm time.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Q9. If the alarm is beeping at timepoint 3, what can be inferred about the state of the alarm being on or off at that moment?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A9.** If the alarm is beeping at timepoint 3, it can be inferred that the alarm was on at the moment the alarm time was reached (timepoint 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q10. How would the outcome change if the alarm was never turned on after being set? Describe the state of the alarm at timepoint 3.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A10.** If the alarm was set to timepoint 2 but never turned on, then at timepoint 3, the alarm would not be beeping because the condition for beeping (alarm time matching the present moment and the alarm being on) would not be satisfied.\n",
