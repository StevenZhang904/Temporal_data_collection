An agent picks up a book. While the agent is holding the book, its location is
not subject to the commonsense law of inertia. Instead, its location varies with the
location of the agent holding it.
We modify the example in Section 6.1.1 to use release axioms and state constraints
instead of effect axioms. If an agent picks up an object, then the room of the object
will be released from the commonsense law of inertia:
Releases(PickUp(a, o), InRoom(o, r), t)
(6.45)
Whenever an agent is holding an object, if the agent is in one room, then the object
is also in that room:
HoldsAt(Holding(a, o), t) ∧
HoldsAt(InRoom(a, r), t) ⇒
HoldsAt(InRoom(o, r), t)
(6.46)
If an agent is in a room and the agent lets go of an object, then the object will be in
the room, and the fact that the object is in that room will no longer be released from
the commonsense law of inertia:
HoldsAt(InRoom(a, r), t) ⇒
Initiates(LetGoOf (a, o), InRoom(o, r), t)
(6.47)
Unlike with the use of effect axioms for representing indirect effects, if we add
running as another way of moving from room to room, we do not have to add any
further axioms. The state constraint (6.46) represents an indirect effect of an agent’s
location, no matter how the agent’s location is changed.
Suppose we have the following observations and narrative. At first, Nathan and
the book are in the living room:
¬ReleasedAt(f , t)
HoldsAt(InRoom(Nathan, LivingRoom), 0)
HoldsAt(InRoom(Book, LivingRoom), 0)
Then Nathan picks up the book and walks into the kitchen:
Happens(PickUp(Nathan, Book), 0)
Happens(Walk(Nathan, LivingRoom, Kitchen), 1)
(6.48)
(6.49)
(6.50)
(6.51)
(6.52)
We also have the fact
same room:
that
the living room and the kitchen are not
the
LivingRoom (cid:2)= Kitchen
(6.53)
We can show that the book will end up in the kitchen.
