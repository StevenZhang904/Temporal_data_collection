This example is due to Erik Sandewall. We modify the example in Section 5.2.1 as
follows. If a gun is loaded and an agent spins the gun, then the gun’s readiness to
shoot will no longer be subject to the commonsense law of inertia:
HoldsAt(Loaded(g), t) ⇒ Releases(Spin(a, g), Loaded(g), t)
(5.30)
Instead of waiting at timepoint 1, Nathan spins the gun:
Happens(Spin(Nathan, Gun), 1)
(5.31)
Notice that given axioms (5.15), (5.27), and (5.29), axiom (5.18) ensures that, after
a loaded gun is fired, the gun is no longer loaded and Loaded(Gun) is no longer
released from the commonsense law of inertia.
The fluent term Alive(Turkey) is subject to the commonsense law of inertia at all
times:
¬ReleasedAt(Alive(Turkey), t)
Only initially is Loaded(Gun) subject to the commonsense law of inertia:
¬ReleasedAt(Loaded(Gun), 0)
(5.32)
(5.33)
We can then show that there are two possible outcomes: (1) If the gun is
loaded at timepoint 2, then the turkey will no longer be alive at timepoint 3, and
(2) if the gun is not loaded at timepoint 2, then the turkey will still be alive at
timepoint 3.
