Consider the example of turning on a device. We introduce the abnormality predicate
Ab1(d, t), which represents that device d is abnormal in some way at timepoint t. We
use this predicate in an effect axiom. If a device is not Ab1 and an agent turns on the
device, then the device will be on:
¬Ab1(d, t) ⇒ Initiates(TurnOn(a, d), On(d), t)
(12.7)
We add cancellation axioms that represent qualifications. A device is Ab1 if its switch
is broken:
HoldsAt(BrokenSwitch(d), t) ⇒ Ab1(d, t)
A device is Ab1 if it is not plugged in:
¬HoldsAt(PluggedIn(d), t) ⇒ Ab1(d, t)
(12.8)
(12.9)
A particular antique device never works:
Ab1(AntiqueDevice1, t)
(12.10)
Now consider the following observations and narrative in which the device is
initially off and then the device is turned on:
¬HoldsAt(On(Device1), 0)
¬ReleasedAt( f , t)
Happens(TurnOn(Nathan, Device1), 0)
(12.11)
(12.12)
(12.13)
Suppose that the device’s switch is not broken, the device is plugged in, and the device
is not the antique device:
¬HoldsAt(BrokenSwitch(Device1), 0)
HoldsAt(PluggedIn(Device1), 0)
Device1 (cid:7)= AntiqueDevice1
(12.14)
(12.15)
(12.16)
We can then show that the device will be on at timepoint 1.
