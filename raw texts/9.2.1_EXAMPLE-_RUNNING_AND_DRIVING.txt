We start with a disjunctive event axiom that says that, if an agent goes to a location,
then the agent runs or drives to that location:
Happens(Go(a, l), t) ⇒
Happens(Run(a, l), t) ∨
Happens(Drive(a, l), t)
(9.15)
We have an effect axiom that says that, if an agent runs to a location, then the agent
will be tired:
Initiates(Run(a, l), Tired(a), t)
(9.16)
Suppose we are told that Nathan was initially not tired and went to the bookstore:
¬ReleasedAt( f , t)
¬HoldsAt(Tired(Nathan), 0)
Happens(Go(Nathan, Bookstore), 0)
(9.19)
The event Go(Nathan, Bookstore) has a nondeterministic effect: Nathan may or may
not be tired afterward. Now suppose we are told that Nathan was tired afterward:
(9.18)
(9.17)
We can then show that Nathan must have run to the bookstore.
HoldsAt(Tired(Nathan), 1)
