We start by considering the example of shooting a turkey. If a gun is loaded at
timepoint 1 and used to shoot a turkey at timepoint 3, then the gun will fire and the
turkey will no longer be alive. This simple example assumes that the shooter does not
miss. In this case, the fact that the gun is loaded is subject to the commonsense law
of inertia.
This example is due to Steve Hanks and Drew McDermott. If an agent loads a
gun, then the gun will be loaded:
Initiates(Load(a, g), Loaded(g), t)
(5.16)
If a gun is loaded and agent a1 shoots the gun at agent a2, then a2 will no longer be
alive:
HoldsAt(Loaded(g), t) ⇒
Terminates(Shoot(a1, a2, g), Alive(a2), t)
(5.17)
If a gun is loaded and an agent shoots the gun, then the gun will no longer be loaded:
HoldsAt(Loaded(g), t) ⇒
Terminates(Shoot(a1, a2, g), Loaded(g), t)
(5.18)
Consider the following observations and narrative. Initially, the turkey is alive and
the gun is not loaded:
HoldsAt(Alive(Turkey), 0)
¬HoldsAt(Loaded(Gun), 0)
(5.19)
(5.20)
Nathan loads the gun at timepoint 0, waits at timepoint 1, and shoots the turkey at
timepoint 2:
Happens(Load(Nathan, Gun), 0)
Happens(Wait(Nathan), 1)
Happens(Shoot(Nathan, Turkey, Gun), 2)
(5.21)
(5.22)
(5.23)
We can then show that the turkey will no longer be alive at timepoint 3.
