Consider a camera with a flash unit. If a camera’s shutter is released at the same
instant that its flash is triggered, then we have the cumulative effect that a properly
exposed picture is taken:
Happens(TriggerFlash(c), t) ⇒
Initiates(ReleaseShutter(c), ProperlyExposedPicture(t), t)
(8.2)
If a camera’s shutter is released and its flash is not triggered at the same instant, then
an improperly exposed picture is taken:
¬Happens(TriggerFlash(c), t) ⇒
Initiates(ReleaseShutter(c), ImproperlyExposedPicture(t), t)
(8.3)
The shutter is released at timepoints 0 and 1, but only at timepoint 1 is the flash
triggered:
¬ReleasedAt(f , t)
Happens(ReleaseShutter(Camera), 0)
Happens(TriggerFlash(Camera), 1)
Happens(ReleaseShutter(Camera), 1)
(8.4)
(8.5)
(8.6)
(8.7)
We can show that an improperly exposed picture is taken at timepoint 0 and that a
properly exposed picture is taken at timepoint 1.
