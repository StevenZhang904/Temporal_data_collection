An agent picks up a book; the book then moves along with the agent. We start with
the following spatial theory. If an agent walks from room r1 to room r2, then the agent
will be in r2 and will no longer be in r1:
Initiates(Walk(a, r1, r2), InRoom(a, r2), t)
r1 (cid:2)= r2 ⇒ Terminates(Walk(a, r1, r2), InRoom(a, r1), t)
An object is in one room at a time:
HoldsAt(InRoom(o, r1), t) ∧ HoldsAt(InRoom(o, r2), t) ⇒
r1 = r2
(6.1)
(6.2)
(6.3)
If an agent is in the same room as an object and the agent picks up the object, then
the agent will be holding the object:
HoldsAt(InRoom(a, r), t) ∧ HoldsAt(InRoom(o, r), t) ⇒
Initiates(PickUp(a, o), Holding(a, o), t)
(6.4)
If an agent is holding an object and the agent lets go of the object, then the agent will
no longer be holding the object:
HoldsAt(Holding(a, o), t) ⇒
Terminates(LetGoOf (a, o), Holding(a, o), t)
(6.5)
We then represent the indirect effects of walking while holding an object using
positive and negative effect axioms. If an agent is holding an object and the agent
walks from room r1 to room r2, then the object will be in r2 and will no longer
be in r1:
HoldsAt(Holding(a, o), t) ⇒
Initiates(Walk(a, r1, r2), InRoom(o, r2), t)
HoldsAt(Holding(a, o), t) ∧ r1 (cid:2)= r2 ⇒
Terminates(Walk(a, r1, r2), InRoom(o, r1), t)
(6.6)
(6.7)
Now consider the following observations and narrative. Nathan and the book start
out in the living room:
¬ReleasedAt(f , t)
HoldsAt(InRoom(Nathan, LivingRoom), 0)
HoldsAt(InRoom(Book, LivingRoom), 0)
Nathan picks up the book and walks into the kitchen:
Happens(PickUp(Nathan, Book), 0)
Happens(Walk(Nathan, LivingRoom, Kitchen), 1)
We also have
LivingRoom (cid:2)= Kitchen
(6.8)
(6.9)
(6.10)
(6.11)
(6.12)
(6.13)
We can then show that the book will be in the kitchen.
