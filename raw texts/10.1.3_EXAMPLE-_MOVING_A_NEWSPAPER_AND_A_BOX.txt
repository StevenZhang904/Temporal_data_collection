Lisa, a newspaper, and a box are in the living room. She puts the newspaper in the
box, picks up the box, and walks into the kitchen:
HoldsAt(IN(Lisa, LivingRoom), 0)
HoldsAt(IN(Newspaper, LivingRoom), 0)
HoldsAt(IN(Box, LivingRoom), 0)
Happens(MOVE(Lisa, Newspaper, LivingRoom, Box), 0)
Happens(MOVE(Lisa, Box, LivingRoom, Lisa), 1)
Happens(MOVE(Lisa, Lisa, LivingRoom, Kitchen), 2)
Lisa then sets down the box and walks back into the living room:
Happens(MOVE(Lisa, Box, Lisa, Kitchen), 3)
Happens(MOVE(Lisa, Lisa, Kitchen, LivingRoom), 4)
(10.1)
(10.2)

(10.6)

(10.8)
The fluent INROOM is always released from the commonsense law of inertia, and IN
is never released from this law:
ReleasedAt(INROOM(o1, o2), t)
Â¬ReleasedAt(IN(o1, o2), t)
(10.9)
(10.10)
We can show that Lisa will be in the living room, but the newspaper and box will be
in the kitchen.
