Suppose that in order for an agent to walk through a door, the agent must be near
the door:
Happens(WalkThroughDoor(a, d), t) ⇒ HoldsAt(Near(a, d), t)
(3.41)
Suppose further that Nathan is not near a door and walks through a door:
¬HoldsAt(Near(Nathan, Door), 1)
Happens(WalkThroughDoor(Nathan, Door), 1)
(3.42)
(3.43)
We then get inconsistency.
