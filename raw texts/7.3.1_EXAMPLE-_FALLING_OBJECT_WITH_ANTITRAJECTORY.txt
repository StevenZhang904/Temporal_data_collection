Consider again the example of the falling object. First, we state that the height of an
object is always released from the commonsense law of inertia:
Then, we replace (7.7) and (7.11) with
ReleasedAt(Height(o, h), t)
HoldsAt(Height(o, h), t1) â‡’
AntiTrajectory(Falling(o), t1, Height(o, h), t2)
(7.44)
(7.45)
That is, when an object stops falling, its height stays constant.
We can show that the apple hits the ground at timepoint 1, and has a height of zero
at timepoint 2.
