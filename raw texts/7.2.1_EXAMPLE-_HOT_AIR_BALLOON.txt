This example and the trajectory and antitrajectory axioms are due to Rob Miller and
Murray Shanahan. We have two effect axioms. If an agent turns on the heater of a hot
air balloon, then the heater will be on:
Initiates(TurnOnHeater(a, b), HeaterOn(b), t)
(7.30)
If an agent turns off the heater of a hot air balloon, then the heater will no longer
be on:
Terminates(TurnOffHeater(a, b), HeaterOn(b), t)
We have a state constraint:
HoldsAt(Height(b, h1), t) ∧
HoldsAt(Height(b, h2), t) ⇒
h1 = h2
We have the following trajectory and antitrajectory axioms:
HoldsAt(Height(b, h), t1) ⇒
Trajectory(HeaterOn(b), t1, Height(b, h + V · t2), t2)
HoldsAt(Height(b, h), t1) ⇒
AntiTrajectory(HeaterOn(b), t1, Height(b, h − V · t2), t2)
(7.31)
(7.32)
(7.33)
(7.34)
where V is the velocity of the balloon.
We have the following observations and narrative. The balloon starts out at
height 0:
HoldsAt(Height(Balloon, 0), 0)
(7.35)
The height of a balloon is always released from the commonsense law of inertia:
ReleasedAt(Height(b, h), t)
(7.36)
At timepoint 0 the heater is turned on, and at timepoint 2 the heater is turned off:
Happens(TurnOnHeater(Nathan, Balloon), 0)
Happens(TurnOffHeater(Nathan, Balloon), 2)
(7.37)
(7.38)
We can show that the height of the balloon is 2V at timepoint 2 and is V at
timepoint 3.
