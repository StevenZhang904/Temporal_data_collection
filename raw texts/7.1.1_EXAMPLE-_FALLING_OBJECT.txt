An object O1 is at rest at height H prior to timepoint T1, starts to fall at timepoint T1,
and hits the ground at timepoint T2 = T1 +
2H/G, where G is the acceleration due
to gravity (9.8 m/s2):
√
t ≤ T1 ⇒ HoldsAt(Height(O1, H), t)
t > T1 ∧ t ≤ T2 ⇒ HoldsAt(Height(O1, H − 1
t > T2 ⇒ HoldsAt(Height(O1, 0), t)
G(t − T1)2), t)

We have a state constraint that says that an object has a unique height at any
given time:
HoldsAt(Height(o, h1), t) ∧ HoldsAt(Height(o, h2), t) ⇒
h1 = h2
(7.4)
The height of O1 is released from the commonsense law of inertia:
ReleasedAt(Height(O1, h), t)
(7.5)
From this axiomatization, we can determine the height of O1 at any timepoint. For
instance, if (T1 + 2) ≤ T2, then the height of O1 at timepoint T1 + 2 is H − 2G.
