Now consider the following scenario involving five locations: The location L1 is to
the left of L2, which is to the left of L3, which is to the left of L4, which is to the left
of L5:
(10.87)
Adjacent(l1, l2) ⇔
(l1 = L1 ∧ l2 = L2) ∨
(l1 = L2 ∧ l2 = L1) ∨
(l1 = L2 ∧ l2 = L3) ∨
(l1 = L3 ∧ l2 = L2) ∨
(l1 = L3 ∧ l2 = L4) ∨
(l1 = L4 ∧ l2 = L3) ∨
(l1 = L4 ∧ l2 = L5) ∨
(l1 = L5 ∧ l2 = L4)
Locations L2 and L4 are blocked by screens.
