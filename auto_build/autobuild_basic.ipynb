    "AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool, or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation.\n",
    "Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we introduce a new class, `AgentBuilder`, to help user build an automatic task solving process powered by multi-agent system. Specifically, in `build()`, we prompt a LLM to create multiple participant agent and initialize a group chat, and specify whether this task need programming to solve. AgentBuilder also support open-source LLMs by [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html) and [Fastchat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat). Check the supported model list [here](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html)."

      "**Netdata** is a high-performance, cloud-native, and on-premises observability platform designed to monitor metrics and logs with unparalleled efficiency. It delivers a simpler, faster, and significantly easier approach to real-time, low-latency monitoring for systems, containers, and applications. Netdata requires **zero-configuration** to get started, offering a powerful and comprehensive monitoring experience, out of the box.\n",
      "\n",
      "Netdata is also known for its **cost-efficient, distributed design**. Unlike traditional monitoring solutions that centralize data, **Netdata distributes the code**. Instead of funneling all data into a few central databases, Netdata processes data at the edge, keeping it close to the source. The smart open-source Netdata Agent acts as a distributed database, enabling the construction of complex observability pipelines with modular, Lego-like simplicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Netdata provides **A.I. insights** for all monitored data, training machine learning models directly at the edge. This allows for fully automated and unsupervised anomaly detection, and with its intuitive APIs and UIs, users can quickly perform root cause analysis and troubleshoot issues, identifying correlations and gaining deeper insights into their infrastructure.\n",

      "### The Netdata Ecosystem\n",
      "\n",
      "Netdata is built on three core components:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Netdata Agent** (usually called just \"Netdata\"): This open-source component is the heart of the Netdata ecosystem, handling data collection, storage (embedded database), querying, machine learning, exporting, and alerting of observability data. All observability data and features a Netdata ecosystem offers, are managed by the Netdata Agent. It runs in physical and virtual servers, cloud environments, Kubernetes clusters, and edge/IoT devices and is carefully optimized to have _**zero impact**_ on production systems and applications.\n",

      "    \n",
      "2.  **Netdata Cloud**: Enhancing the Netdata Agent, Netdata Cloud offers enterprise features such as user management, role-based access control, horizontal scalability, alert and notification management, access from anywhere, and more.  Netdata Cloud does **not** centralize or store observability data.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    _Netdata Cloud is a commercial product, available as an on-premises installation, or a SaaS solution, with a free community tier._\n",
      "    \n",

      "    \n",
      "    _While closed-source, it is free to use with both Netdata Agents and Netdata Cloud, via their public APIs. It is included in the binary packages offered by Netdata and its latest version is publicly available via a CDN._\n",

The Netdata Agents eliminate the need to centralize logs and provide all the functions to work with logs directly at the edge.\n",

      "- :star: **Lego like, Observability Pipelines**<br/>\n",

      "- :fire: **Fully Automated Powerful Visualization**<br/>\n",
      "  Using the NIDL (Nodes, Instances, Dimensions & Labels) data model, the Netdata Agent enables the creation of fully automated dashboards, providing corellated visualization of all metrics, allowing you to understand any dataset at first sight, but also to filter, slice and dice the data directly on the dashboards, without the need to learn a query language.\n",

Of course, these depend on how many metrics are collected.\n",

Also, metrics are packed into bigger blocks we call `extents` and are compressed with ZSTD before saving them, to minimize the number of I/O operations made.\n",

      "Netdata is a \"ready to use\" monitoring solution. Prometheus and Grafana are tools to build your own monitoring solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Netdata is also a lot faster, requires significantly less resources and puts almost no stress on the server it runs. For a performance comparison check [this blog](https://blog.netdata.cloud/netdata-vs-prometheus-performance-analysis/).\n",

      "First, we have to say that Prometheus as a time-series database and Grafana as a visualizer are excellent tools for what they do.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, we believe that such a setup is missing a key element: A Prometheus and Grafana setup assumes that you know everything about the metrics you collect and you understand deeply how they are structured, they should be queried and visualized.\n",
      "\n",
      "In reality, this setup has a lot of problems. The vast number of technologies, operating systems, and applications we use in our modern stacks, makes it impossible for any single person to know and understand everything about anything. We get testimonials regularly from Netdata users across the biggest enterprises, that Netdata manages to reveal issues, anomalies and problems they were not aware of and they didn't even have the means to find or troubleshoot.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the biggest difference of Netdata to Prometheus, and Grafana, is that we decided that the tool needs to have a much better understanding of the components, the applications, and the metrics it monitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "  - When compared to Prometheus, Netdata needs for each metric much more than just a name, some labels, and a value over time. A metric in Netdata is a structured entity that correlates with other metrics in a certain way and has specific attributes that depict how it should be organized, treated, queried, and visualized. We call this the NIDL (Nodes, Instances, Dimensions, Labels) framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Maintaining such an index is a challenge: first, because the raw metrics collected do not provide this information, so we have to add it, and second because we need to maintain this index for the lifetime of each metric, which with our current database retention, it is usually more than a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "    At the same time, Netdata provides better retention than Prometheus due to database tiering, scales easier than Prometheus due to streaming, supports anomaly detection and it has a metrics scoring engine to find the needle in the haystack when needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "  - When compared to Grafana, Netdata is fully automated. Grafana has more customization capabilities than Netdata, but Netdata presents fully functional dashboards by itself and most importantly it gives you the means to understand, analyze, filter, slice and dice the data without the need for you to edit queries or be aware of any peculiarities the underlying metrics may have.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Furthermore, to help you when you need to find the needle in the haystack, Netdata has advanced troubleshooting tools provided by the Netdata metrics scoring engine, that allows it to score metrics based on their anomaly rate, their differences or similarities for any given time frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, if you are already familiar with Prometheus and Grafana, Netdata integrates nicely with them, and we have reports from users who use Netdata with Prometheus and Grafana in production.\n",
