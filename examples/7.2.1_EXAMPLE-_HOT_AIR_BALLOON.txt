This example and the trajectory and antitrajectory axioms are due to Rob Miller and Murray Shanahan. We have two effect axioms. If an agent turns on the heater of a hot air balloon, then the heater will be on.

If an agent turns off the heater of a hot air balloon, then the heater will no longer be on.

We have a state constraint.

We have the following trajectory and antitrajectory axioms.

AntiTrajectory(HeaterOn(b), t1, Height(b, h − V · t2), t2) where V is the velocity of the balloon.

We have the following observations and narrative. The balloon starts out at height 0.

The height of a balloon is always released from the commonsense law of inertia.

At timepoint 0 the heater is turned on, and at timepoint 2 the heater is turned off.

We can show that the height of the balloon is 2V at timepoint 2 and is V at timepoint 3.
