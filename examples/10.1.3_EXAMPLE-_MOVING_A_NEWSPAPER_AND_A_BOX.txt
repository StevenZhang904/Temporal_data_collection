Lisa, a newspaper, and a box are in the living room. She puts the newspaper in the box, picks up the box, and walks into the kitchen.

Lisa then sets down the box and walks back into the living room.

We can show that Lisa will be in the living room, but the newspaper and box will be in the kitchen.
