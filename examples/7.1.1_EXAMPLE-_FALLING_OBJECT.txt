An object O1 is at rest at height H prior to timepoint T1, starts to fall at timepoint T1, √ G(t − T1)2), t) We have a state constraint that says that an object has a unique height at any given time.

The height of O1 is released from the commonsense law of inertia.

From this axiomatization, we can determine the height of O1 at any timepoint. For
