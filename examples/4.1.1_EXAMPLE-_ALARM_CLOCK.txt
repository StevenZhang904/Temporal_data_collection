Whenever we use an alarm clock, we perform commonsense reasoning about triggered events. The alarm going off is a triggered event, and we can formalize the operation of an alarm clock using trigger axioms.

We start with some effect axioms. If a clock’s alarm time is t1 and an agent sets the clock’s alarm time to t2, then the clock’s alarm time will be t2 and will no longer be t1.

If an agent turns on a clock’s alarm, then it will be on.

If an agent turns off a clock’s alarm, then it will no longer be on.

If an alarm starts beeping, then it will be beeping.

If an agent turns off a clock’s alarm, then the clock will no longer be beeping.

We have a state constraint that says that a clock has a unique alarm time at any given time.

Now we use a trigger axiom. If a clock’s alarm time is the present moment and the alarm is on, then the clock starts beeping.

Let us use the following observations and narrative. At timepoint 0, the alarm is not on, the alarm is not beeping, and the alarm time is set to 10.

At timepoint 0, Nathan sets the alarm clock for timepoint 2; and at timepoint 1, he turns on the alarm.

We can then show that the alarm clock will be beeping at timepoint 3.
