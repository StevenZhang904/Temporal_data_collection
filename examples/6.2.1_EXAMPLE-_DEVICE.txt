We start with some positive and negative effect axioms. If an agent switches on a device, then the device will be switched on.

If an agent switches off a device, then the device will no longer be switched on.

If an agent plugs in a device, then the device will be plugged in.

If an agent unplugs a device, then the device will no longer be plugged in.

We use a state constraint to represent the fact that a device is on whenever the device is switched on and the device is plugged in.

The order in which the device is switched on and plugged in does not matter. The device will be on once it is both switched on and plugged in.

Unlike the use of effect axioms for representing indirect effects, when we add other events that initiate or terminate SwitchedOn, we do not have to add any further axioms. The state constraint (6.27) represents an indirect effect of SwitchedOn, no matter how SwitchedOn is initiated or terminated. The same is true for Plugged In.

Consider the following observations and narrative. Initially, the device is neither switched on nor plugged in.

Then Nathan switches on and plugs in the device.

We can show that the device will then be on.
