Consider again the example in Section 6.1.1. We may represent the indirect effects of walking from one room to another using effect constraints.

Unfortunately, we cannot use predicate completion and Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 to compute Releases], because Initiates is contained in the antecedent of (6.63) and Terminates is contained in the antecedent of (6.64). (This can be handled by answer set programming—see Section 15.3.4.) Instead we simply use (6.63) and (6.64) to derive the effect axioms in Section 6.1.1 that represent the indirect effects. From we have which is (6.6). From (6.64) and we have which is (6.7).

Michael Thielscher devised the electronic circuit shown in Figure 6.1 in order to point out problems with solutions to the ramification problem based on dividing fluents S1 B S2 R L S3 FIGURE 6.1 Thielscher’s circuit (Thielscher, 1996, p. 19).

into primitive and derived fluents, as discussed in Section 6.2. The circuit consists of a battery (B), three switches (S1, S2, and S3), a relay (R), and a light (L). A switch can be open or closed, the relay can be activated or not activated, and the light can be lit or not lit. Relay R is activated whenever S1 and S3 are closed. Light L is lit whenever S1 and S2 are closed. Relay R is connected to switch S2, so that when R is activated, S2 is opened.

One behavior of this circuit is as follows. Suppose that initially S1 is open, S2 and S3 are closed, R is not activated, and L is not lit. If we close S1, then R will be activated and S2 will be opened. Because S2 is open, the result will be that light L is not lit.

Now suppose we try to model this behavior using primitive and derived fluents.

We use primitive fluents for S1 and S3.

We use derived fluents for R and L.

It is not clear what to use for S2, which appears to be both primitive and derived.

On the one hand, S2 can be manually opened and closed.

On the other hand, S2 is open whenever R is activated.

Unfortunately, if we use all three axioms (6.71), (6.72), and (6.73), then we get inconsistency. To see this, consider the following observations and narrative.

Proposition Proof. From CIRC[(cid.2); Initiates, Terminates, Releases] and Theorems 2.1 and 2.2, we have Then ¬Releases(e, f , t).

From CIRC[(cid.3); Happens] and Theorem 2.1, we have From (6.80) (which follows from (6.84)), (6.65) (which follows from (6.81)), and DEC9, we have HoldsAt(Closed(S1), 1). From this, (6.76), and (6.69), we have HoldsAt(Activated(R), 1). From this and (6.73), we have Yet, Closed(S2), 0)). From this, (6.75), (6.79), and DEC5, we have HoldsAt (Closed(S2), 1), (cid.2) which contradicts (6.85).

Thus, it does not work for S2 to be both a primitive and derived fluent.

In order to deal with this circuit, or any commonsense reasoning problem in which indirect effects interact with one another instantaneously, Murray Shanahan enhances the event calculus as follows. First, he adds the following four predicates.

Started(f , t). Fluent f is true at timepoint t, or f is initiated by an event that occurs at t. We say that f is started at t.

Stopped(f , t). Fluent f is false at timepoint t, or f is terminated by an event that occurs at t. We say that f is stopped at t.

Initiated(f , t). Fluent f is started at timepoint t, and f is not terminated by any event that occurs at t.

Terminated(f , t). Fluent f is stopped at timepoint t, and f is not initiated by any event that occurs at t.

Second, he adds the following axioms.

Axiom CC1.

Axiom CC2.

Axiom CC3.

Axiom CC4.

We use CC to mean the conjunction of axioms CC1 through CC4. Third, Shanahan introduces a new type of axiom called a causal constraint.

Definition 6.2. If α is an event term, β and β1, . . . , βn are fluent terms, θ is Stopped or Started, π1, . . . , πn are Initiated or Terminated, and τ is a timepoint term, then is a causal constraint.
