Given that Nathan was not awake and then he was awake, we can abduce that he woke up. Abduction can be performed using answer set programming. We create a file called sleep.pl containing the following.

time(0).

fluent(awake(nathan)).

event(wakeUp(nathan)).

event(fallAsleep(nathan)).

holdsAt(awake(nathan),1).
