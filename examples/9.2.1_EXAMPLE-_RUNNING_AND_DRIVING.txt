We start with a disjunctive event axiom that says that, if an agent goes to a location, then the agent runs or drives to that location.

Happens(Run(a, l), t) âˆ¨ We have an effect axiom that says that, if an agent runs to a location, then the agent will be tired.

Suppose we are told that Nathan was initially not tired and went to the bookstore.

The event Go(Nathan, Bookstore) has a nondeterministic effect. Nathan may or may not be tired afterward. Now suppose we are told that Nathan was tired afterward.

We can then show that Nathan must have run to the bookstore.
