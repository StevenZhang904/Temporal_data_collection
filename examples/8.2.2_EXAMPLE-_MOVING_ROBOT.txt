Another example is that of a simple robot. At any time, the robot has a unique location in two-dimensional space.

And at any time, a robot has a unique direction given by an angle in radians measured counterclockwise from the x axis.

A robot has a left wheel and a right wheel. The wheels can be moved separately or at the same time. Moving the left wheel cancels the effect of moving the right wheel, and moving the right wheel cancels the effect of moving the left wheel. Thus, if a (1 degree).

If a robot moves its only right wheel, then the robot will rotate counterclockwise by Moving the left and right wheels simultaneously has a cumulative effect. Namely, if a robot moves its left and right wheels at the same time, then the robot will move forward by one unit.

Consider the following observations and narrative. The robot is initially at location (cid.9)0, 0(cid.10), and its direction is 0 (facing right).

At timepoint 0, the robot moves its right wheel; at timepoint 1, the robot moves both its left and right wheels.

Proposition we have Proof. From CIRC[(cid.6); Initiates, Terminates, Releases] and Theorems 2.1 and 2.2, we have HoldsAt(Direction(r, d), t)) ∨ HoldsAt(Direction(r, d), t)) ∨ HoldsAt(Direction(r, d), t)) ∨ HoldsAt(Direction(r, d), t)) ∨ ¬Releases(e, f , t) From CIRC[(cid.7); Happens] and Theorem 2.1, we have From (8.29), we have ¬Happens(MoveLeftWheel(Robot), 0). From this, (8.23) (which follows from (8.29)), (8.22), (8.16) (which follows from (8.26)), and DEC9, we have (Robot, 0, 0), 0)). From this, (8.21), (8.20), and DEC5, we have HoldsAt (Location (Robot, 0, 0), 1). From this, (8.24) and (8.25) (which both follow from (8.29)), (8.30), (cid.2)
