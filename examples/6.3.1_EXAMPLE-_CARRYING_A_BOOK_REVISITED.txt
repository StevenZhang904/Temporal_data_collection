An agent picks up a book. While the agent is holding the book, its location is not subject to the commonsense law of inertia. Instead, its location varies with the location of the agent holding it.

We modify the example in Section 6.1.1 to use release axioms and state constraints instead of effect axioms. If an agent picks up an object, then the room of the object will be released from the commonsense law of inertia.

Releases(PickUp(a, o), InRoom(o, r), t) Whenever an agent is holding an object, if the agent is in one room, then the object is also in that room.

If an agent is in a room and the agent lets go of an object, then the object will be in the room, and the fact that the object is in that room will no longer be released from the commonsense law of inertia.

Unlike with the use of effect axioms for representing indirect effects, if we add running as another way of moving from room to room, we do not have to add any further axioms. The state constraint (6.46) represents an indirect effect of an agent’s location, no matter how the agent’s location is changed.

Suppose we have the following observations and narrative. At first, Nathan and the book are in the living room.

Then Nathan picks up the book and walks into the kitchen.

We also have the fact same room.

that the living room and the kitchen are not the We can show that the book will end up in the kitchen.
