The circumscription of the running and driving example in Section 9.2.1 can be handled in answer set programming. We specify entities, fluents, and events.

agent(nathan).

location(bookstore).

fluent(tired(A)) .- agent(A).

event(go(A,L)) .- agent(A), location(L).

event(run(A,L)) .- agent(A), location(L).

event(drive(A,L)) .- agent(A), location(L).

We write a disjunctive event axiom that specifies that, if an agent goes to a location, then the agent runs or drives to that location.

happens(run(A,L),T) | happens(drive(A,L),T) .- happens(go(A,L),T).

We write an effect axiom that says that, if an agent runs to a location, then the agent will be tired.

initiates(run(A,L),tired(A),T) .- agent(A), location(L), time(T).

Now we specify that Nathan was initially not tired and went to the bookstore.

.- holdsAt(tired(nathan),0).

happens(go(nathan,bookstore),0).

Finally, we specify that Nathan was tired afterward.

holdsAt(tired(nathan),1).

We specify that fluents are not released at timepoint 0.

.- releasedAt(F,0), fluent(F).

We then run clingo as follows.

It is correctly inferred that Nathan ran to the bookstore.
