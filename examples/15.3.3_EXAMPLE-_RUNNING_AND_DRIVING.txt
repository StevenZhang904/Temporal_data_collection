The circumscription of the running and driving example in Section 9.2.1 can be handled in answer set programming. We specify entities, fluents, and events.

agent(nathan).

location(bookstore).

We write a disjunctive event axiom that specifies that, if an agent goes to a location, then the agent runs or drives to that location.

We write an effect axiom that says that, if an agent runs to a location, then the agent will be tired.

Now we specify that Nathan was initially not tired and went to the bookstore.

happens(go(nathan,bookstore),0).

Finally, we specify that Nathan was tired afterward.

holdsAt(tired(nathan),1).

We specify that fluents are not released at timepoint 0.

We then run clingo as follows.

It is correctly inferred that Nathan ran to the bookstore.
