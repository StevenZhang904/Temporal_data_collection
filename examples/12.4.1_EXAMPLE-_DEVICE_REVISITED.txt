Consider the example of turning on a device. We introduce the abnormality predicate Ab1(d, t), which represents that device d is abnormal in some way at timepoint t. We use this predicate in an effect axiom. If a device is not Ab1 and an agent turns on the device, then the device will be on.

We add cancellation axioms that represent qualifications. A device is Ab1 if its switch is broken.

A device is Ab1 if it is not plugged in.

A particular antique device never works.

Ab1(AntiqueDevice1, t) Now consider the following observations and narrative in which the device is initially off and then the device is turned on.

Suppose that the deviceâ€™s switch is not broken, the device is plugged in, and the device is not the antique device.

We can then show that the device will be on at timepoint 1.
