An important use of state constraints is to simplify the specification of initial conditions. We can use state constraints to tighten up the telephone axiomatization given in Section 3.1.1.

We add several axioms. A phone cannot be ringing itself.

If phone p1 is ringing phone p2, then p2 cannot be ringing p1.

A phone cannot be connected to itself.

If phone p1 is connected to phone p2, then p2 cannot be connected to p1.

At any time, a phone either is idle, has a dial tone, has a busy signal, is ringing another phone, is being rung by another phone, is connected to another phone, or is disconnected.

HoldsAt(Idle(p), t) ˙∨ HoldsAt(DialTone(p), t) ˙∨ HoldsAt(BusySignal(p), t) ˙∨ ∃p1 HoldsAt(Ringing(p, p1), t) ˙∨ ∃p1 HoldsAt(Ringing(p1, p), t) ˙∨ ∃p1 HoldsAt(Connected(p, p1), t) ˙∨ ∃p1 HoldsAt(Connected(p1, p), t) ˙∨ These state constraints simplify specification of initial conditions. For example, from HoldsAt(Idle(Phone1), 0), HoldsAt(Idle(Phone2), 0), (3.45), (3.46), (3.47), (3.48), and (3.49), we have all of the following.

Therefore, we no longer have to specify these initial conditions explicitly.
