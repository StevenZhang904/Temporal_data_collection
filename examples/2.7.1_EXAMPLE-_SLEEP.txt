Let us revisit the example in Section 1.4.2. We use an agent sort with the variable a.

The event WakeUp(a) represents that agent a wakes up, the event FallAsleep(a) represents that agent a falls asleep, and the fluent Awake(a) represents that agent a is awake.

Our axiomatization consists of several axioms. We use a positive effect axiom to represent that, if an agent wakes up, then the agent will be awake.

We use a negative effect axiom to represent that, if an agent falls asleep, then the agent will no longer be awake.

We have the following observations and narrative. At timepoint 0, Nathan is not awake and this fact is subject to the commonsense law of inertia.

We have a narrative consisting of a single event occurrence. At timepoint 1, Nathan wakes up.

Given these axioms and the conjunction of axioms EC, we can show that Nathan will be awake at, say, timepoint 3. The Halmos symbol (cid.2) is used to indicate the end of a proof.
